#This is a CSV file.
#The columns are separated by ";" because a list in cmake is just a ";" separated group of strings.
#Names should be in lower case. They will be used as variable names in cmake.
#URLs can be either https URLs or local file paths in cmake-style(directory separator is a forward slash character).
#SHA1 hashes can be generated by running sha1sum command.
#If you need to change abseil's version to a different one, you may also want to update external\abseil-cpp.natvis

#not affect built binaries.
